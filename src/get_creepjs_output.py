    bot: score

        Main indicator of detectability.

        Shows your overall bot probability.

        Example: bot: 0.13:stranger:csl:00000001

        Goal: Keep this as low as possible (under 0.2 is decent).

    lies: count

        Number of detected inconsistencies (lies) in fingerprint data.

        Includes things like mismatched screen dimensions, fake UA, or WebDriver flags.

        Goal: lies (0): none â€” zero lies.

    errors: count

        JavaScript execution errors often caused by headless or missing APIs.

        Goal: errors (0): none

    trust score:

        General trustworthiness rating of the browser fingerprint.

        Expressed as a percentage + letter grade (e.g., 69% D+).

        Goal: 80%+ and at least a B or better.

    shadow: score

        Number of known stealth modifications detected.

        Modifications like changing navigator.webdriver may trigger this.

        Goal: Keep shadow as low as possible (0 ideally).
